# incoming note: rfc006-s5-area-oracle-parity-handoff — the genuine remaining Yosys-absorption work

> **id**: `rfc006-s5-area-oracle-parity` · **opened**: 2026-05-20 KST · **status**: `handoff-open — needs PDK+ABC provisioning first`
> **source**: demiurge session 2026-05-20 — after confirming origin/main's rfc_006 §4 (7 yosys modules) is complete (dispatcher selftest 8/8 PASS), §5 is the one genuine open item of the Yosys absorption.
> **destination repo**: `~/core/hexa-lang/` — the `hexa yosys synth` flow + `stdlib/yosys/` modules live there (D15 / D61). demiurge stays pointer-only.
> **scope**: run the rfc_006 §5 SKY130 area-oracle parity measurement and, on PASS, flip the Yosys absorption to `absorbed=true`.

## Why this is the remaining work (and §4 is NOT)

rfc_006 splits the Yosys absorption into §4 (the 7-module hexa-native re-derivation) and §5 (the measured gate). As of 2026-05-20:

- **§4 — DONE.** origin/main carries hexa-lang commit `4f70ce46` "rfc_006 §4 bodies landed for 7 modules". Measured: `hexa run stdlib/yosys/yosys.hexa` → `yosys dispatcher selftest: 8/8 PASS`. rtlil/read_verilog/passes/liberty/abc_map/write_verilog + the dispatcher all compile and route.
- **§5 — OPEN.** No hexa-native flow has yet synthesized the router RTL against SKY130 and reproduced the cited area oracle. Until that measurement is filed with numbers, `absorbed=true` is BANNED (g3).

## The §5 gate (from rfc_006 §5 / the scaffold PATCHES entry G1-G4)

1. **G1** read `~/core/demiurge/archive/comb/rtl/router_d4.v` + `router_d6.v` (Verilog-2005) — present, confirmed.
2. **G2** synthesize against SKY130 `sky130_fd_sc_hd` standard-cell library.
3. **G3** reproduce the area oracle within ±5%: `router_d4` ≈ 61,763 µm² · `router_d6` ≈ 93,609 µm² · ratio ≈ 1.516×.
4. **G4** file the numbers + provenance into `comb/rtl/synth_comparison.md` (or successor).

## Why it could NOT be done this session — the blocking prerequisites (measured)

The 2026-05-20 demiurge session measured the local toolchain state:

```
$ which abc          → abc not found
$ which yosys        → /opt/homebrew/bin/yosys   (external substrate CLI only)
$ SKY130 PDK         → not present (no ~/pdk*, /usr/local/share/pdk*,
                        /opt/sky130*, no sky130_fd_sc_hd dir under ~)
```

§5 needs, before any measurement can run:

- **SKY130 PDK** — the `sky130_fd_sc_hd` Liberty + tech files (multi-GB download, e.g. via `open_pdks` or the `volare` fetcher).
- **ABC** — the `abc` logic-synthesis binary. rfc_006 D18 mandates the `(7a) bounded-subprocess` pattern: invoke ABC as a documented absorbed-substrate subprocess, fail-loud — NOT a full clean-room ABC re-derivation. So ABC must be built/installed and wired into `stdlib/yosys/abc_map.hexa`.

These are infrastructure-provisioning tasks (download + build), not a single coding session. §5 is a multi-step gate, not a loose end.

## Suggested next action (hexa-lang session, once PDK+ABC are provisioned)

1. Provision SKY130 PDK + `abc` on a build host (a `wilson-pool` linux host — `ubu-2` — is the natural place; it already mirrors the repos).
2. Wire `abc_map.hexa` to the `abc` subprocess (rfc_006 D18 bounded-subprocess) and point the Liberty loader at `sky130_fd_sc_hd`.
3. `hexa yosys synth --top router_d4 --lib sky130_fd_sc_hd.lib router_d4.v` (and `router_d6`), capture the reported cell area.
4. Compare to the oracle (d4 ≈61,763 / d6 ≈93,609 µm², 1.516×) within ±5%. File numbers into `comb/rtl/synth_comparison.md`.
5. ONLY on PASS may the Yosys `measurement_gate` flip to `CLOSED_MEASURED` and `absorbed=true` — filed with the cited numbers (g3).

## Boundary / provenance (g3)

The demiurge 2026-05-20 session contributed nothing to §4 (it was already done on origin/main) and could not run §5 (infra absent). This note exists so §5 is a *named, scoped handoff* rather than a vague "remaining work" — its prerequisites (PDK, ABC) are explicit and measured-absent. Nothing is claimed absorbed; the Yosys `measurement_gate` is `GATE_OPEN` and stays there until §5 G1-G4 are filed with numbers.
