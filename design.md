# hexa-arch — design decisions (audit trail)

### Decision 1 — 공개면 클린룸 (public-surface clean-room research boundary)

**picked**: The redesign proceeds under a *public-surface clean-room*
research boundary — neither open-source-only nor closed-binary
reverse-engineering. In scope: OSS code/specs · arxiv & papers (deep
research) · patents (= public reverse-engineering disclosure) · standards ·
datasheets · proprietary tools' *public documentation* (capability/gap
mapping + clean-room re-derivation only). Refused / out of scope:
closed-binary decompilation · license/DRM circumvention · trade-secret
extraction. CHARTER governance updated accordingly; domain rollout = chip
first to measured parity, then incremental expansion.

**rationale**:
- The legitimate substance of "역설계" is fully reachable from the public
  surface — patents are by definition published reverse-engineering
  material, and arxiv/standards/datasheets reconstruct proprietary-tool
  capability and gaps without touching any closed binary.
- Same pattern the family already uses legitimately (hexa-bio ⟵ *published*
  AlphaFold; hexa-matter ⟵ ASE/pymatgen) — clean-room from public
  disclosure keeps hexa-arch on the established, defensible footing.
- Legally and governance safe: no IP infringement, no license/DRM
  circumvention; consistent with no-over-claim (g1·g2·g3) and
  hexa-native-only (g5).
- Closed-binary decompilation / trade-secret extraction is refused outright
  — excluded explicitly so the audit trail carries no gray area.

### Decision 2 — 별개, 타입드 인터페이스 (hexa-arch ↔ hexa-matter/hexa-bio)

**picked**: hexa-arch stays a *separate sibling* of hexa-matter and hexa-bio.
When a domain's verify/simulate step needs material properties it *calls*
hexa-matter; when it needs molecular/chemical modeling it *calls* hexa-bio —
both over a typed interface contract. Neither repo is absorbed into
hexa-arch. This mirrors the established family idiom where `comb` is a
*consumer* of hexa-arch[chip], not its absorber. (Rejected: B = absorb only
hexa-matter; C = absorb both.) To be reflected in CHARTER/HANDOFF as part of
the broader redesign deliverable.

**rationale**:
- Family architecture consistency — "siblings, decoupled by design" is the
  already-established idiom (CHARTER); making hexa-arch a consumer of
  matter/bio is isomorphic to the comb↔hexa-arch[chip] precedent, zero
  architectural contradiction.
- no-big-bang governance — hexa-matter (16-verb) and hexa-bio
  (WEAVE/NANOBOT) are mature large repos; absorbing them is a big-bang,
  violating HANDOFF §5 "incremental · measured · no big-bang".
- andrej-karpathy simplicity/surgical — hexa-arch needs only a typed
  interface contract to material/molecular properties, not their internals;
  minimum code, no swallowed scope.
- no-over-claim (g3) — hexa-arch does not claim material/molecular
  capability it did not measure; it delegates to the repos that did.

### Decision 3 — 하이브리드 시퀀싱 (chip 깊이-우선 + 공개면 맵 병렬)

**picked**: Named cohort = `chip · cern · antimatter · rtsc · space ·
energy · brain` (7). Sequencing = hybrid (option C): chip is taken
*depth-first* as the domain-map template-proving spike (per HANDOFF §9 —
`rfc_001` NoC-sim absorption first), while a *shallow public-surface map*
(Decision 1 scope) runs in parallel across the other 6 cohort domains.
Depth and "absorbed" claims apply to chip only (measured); the other 6 are
mapping, not capability claims. Remaining ~27 repos = later cohorts.
(Rejected: A = chip-only then later; B = all-7 shallow in parallel.)

**rationale**:
- Aligns with Decisions 1 & 2 — public-surface survey is already authorized
  and cheap; chip's depth path is already pinned by HANDOFF §9 (NoC sim
  first), so the two run without conflict.
- Satisfies the user's exhaustive-panorama intent *and* no-over-claim at
  once — the 6 get a shallow public-surface map (mapping, not claims);
  depth/"absorbed" is measured on chip only.
- andrej-karpathy goal-driven/surgical — proving the domain-map template on
  one domain (chip) before replicating minimizes rework risk across the
  other 6; zero big-bang.

### Decision 4 — 파이프라인 verb 는 가설; 조사-우선 (research-first)

**picked**: The 5 verbs `설계(model)→쌓기(synthesize)→적층(layer)→
검증(verify)→계산(simulate)` are treated as an *unvalidated hypothesis*,
not an SSOT — the user stated they were improvised. Proceed research-first:
run the Decision-1 public-surface survey across the named cohort, brainstorm
the actual domain-neutral spine from evidence, then return a *recommended*
pipeline + domain-map. The former structure-template choice (flat-5 vs
flat-7 vs two-layer) is deferred until the spine is evidence-validated;
deciding table shape before the spine would faithfully instantiate an
unvalidated SSOT.

**rationale**:
- The user explicitly flagged the verbs as off-the-cuff — locking a table
  structure (former Decision 4 option A) onto an unvalidated spine would
  build fidelity to a strawman.
- Already authorized — Decision 1 (public-surface clean-room) and Decision 3
  (hybrid: chip deep + 6 shallow) pre-cleared exactly this survey; this is
  execution, not new scope.
- andrej-karpathy think-before-coding — validate the load-bearing
  assumption (the spine) with cited evidence before committing structure;
  prevents downstream rework across all 7 domains.
- no-over-claim — the recommended spine will be grounded in cited public
  prior art (EDA flow, ISO-15288/V-model, MBSE, PLM, domain lifecycles),
  not asserted.

### Decision 5 — canonical 7-verb pipeline spine (evidence-grounded)

**picked**: The domain-neutral pipeline spine is the cited 7-verb form,
replacing the improvised 5-verb strawman:

  명세 SPECIFY → 구조 ARCHITECT → 설계 DESIGN → 해석 ANALYZE →
  합성 SYNTHESIZE → 검증 VERIFY (VALIDATE bound into the gate) →
  인계 HANDOFF

ANALYZE iterates back into DESIGN/SYNTHESIZE (gate, not terminal). Rejected:
B = minimal 5-verb repair (re-conflates ARCHITECT into DESIGN); C = 9-verb
full ISO-15288 (over-grained for a universal spine). Domain-map structure
follows the previously-recommended option A *generalized to 7 verbs*
(one row per verb + per-domain tool bindings + cross-cutting resources
separated + absorption-order annotation) — this is now evidence-forced
(Agent-3: "treat the recurring stages as universal, specialize per-domain
bindings"), so it is applied as a consequence of this decision rather than
re-gated; user retains veto.

**rationale**:
- Evidence across all 9 surveyed lifecycles (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, V-model,
  NASA SE, FDA design controls, EDA RTL→GDSII, MBSE/OOSEM, PLM, accelerator,
  spacecraft): SPECIFY is a mandatory entry gate and VERIFY/VALIDATE the
  closing gate — the strawman omitted SPECIFY and placed simulate terminal.
- Reconciles the domain-tool reality (Agent-3: model→synthesize→verify→
  simulate recurs across all 6 surveyed domains) — that core is preserved
  inside the 7-verb form; only entry/exit invariants and ANALYZE position
  are corrected.
- Drops the un-transferable 적층/"layer" metal-stack metaphor for
  ARCHITECT/INTEGRATE-class verbs that hold across all 7 named domains
  (Agent-1: "layer" does not survive transfer to accelerator/spacecraft).
- Right altitude — 7 ≈ NASA Phase A–F / PED-4.0 natural phase granularity;
  C(9) over-grained, B(5) re-conflates; no-over-claim: grounded, cited,
  not asserted.
